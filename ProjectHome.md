> ## RDP or Remote Desktop Protocol ##

RDP is an implementation of “Thin Client” which allows a system to be controlled by another system over network by making available the graphical contents of the remote systems desktop to the user on the other system and also taking the inputs from the user and processing it and sending the result back to the user. This application uses internet connection available in the device either through wi-fi or mobile data network to connect to the remote Windows RDP server using its IP address or domain name and establishes a RDP connection, receives data from the remote system, processes it and shows the contents of the remote systems desktop to the user on the devices screen. The user on the other hand can interact with the remote system by using touch gestures. This application takes input from the user, encapsulates the data in RDP packets and sends it to the server for processing.
